# OperaServer
Simple Server proof of concept using MEAN Stack App

To start run:

$ mongod

in one terminal (to start mongo), and in another run:

node index.js

Then access the apps at localhost:8000/editor and localhost:8000/display

There should be no mongo setup required (Mongoose takes care of that in our code)
Just make sure that Mongo and Node are all installed.
